Linear and nonlinear systems of equations are the basis for many, 
if not most, of the models of phenomena in science and 
engineering, and their efficient numerical solution is critical 
to progress in these areas.  This is the first book to be 
published on nonlinear equations since the mid-1980s. Although 
it stresses recent developments in this area, such as 
Newton-Krylov methods, considerable material on linear equations 
has been incorporated. This book focuses on a small number of  
methods and treats them in depth.
<P>
The author provides a complete analysis of the conjugate
gradient and generalized minimum residual iterations as well as 
recent advances including Newton-Krylov methods, incorporation 
of inexactness and noise into the analysis, new proofs and 
implementations of Broyden's method, and globalization of 
inexact Newton methods.
<P>
Examples, methods, and algorithmic choices are based on 
applications to infinite dimensional problems such as 
partial differential equations and integral equations. The 
analysis and proof techniques are constructed with the infinite 
dimensional setting in mind and the computational examples and 
exercises are based on the MATLAB environment.

<H4 ALIGN=center>Audience</H4>
<P>
This book can be used as a tutorial and a reference by 
anyone who needs to solve nonlinear systems of equations or
large linear systems. It may also be used as a textbook 
for introductory courses in nonlinear equations or iterative 
methods or as source material for an introductory course in 
numerical analysis at the graduate level. The reader should 
be familiar with elementary numerical analysis, linear 
algebra, and the central ideas of direct methods for the 
numerical solution of dense linear systems.
