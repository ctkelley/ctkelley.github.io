<P>
This book on iterative methods for linear and nonlinear equations
can be used as a tutorial and a reference by anyone who needs to solve
nonlinear systems of equations or large linear systems.
It may also be used as a textbook
for introductory courses in nonlinear equations or iterative methods or
as source material for an introductory course in numerical analysis at
the graduate level. 
We assume that the reader is familiar with elementary numerical analysis,
linear algebra, and
the central ideas of direct methods for the numerical solution of 
dense linear systems. 
<P>
Our approach is to focus on a small number of methods and treat them in depth. 
Though this book is written
in a finite-dimensional setting, we have selected for coverage mostly
algorithms and methods of analysis which 
extend directly to the infinite-dimensional case and whose convergence
can be thoroughly analyzed. For example,
the matrix-free formulation and analysis for GMRES and conjugate gradient
is almost unchanged in an infinite-dimensional setting.
The analysis of Broyden's method presented in Chapter 7
and the implementations presented in Chapters 7
and 8 are
different from the classical ones and also extend directly
to an infinite-dimensional setting.
The computational 
examples and exercises focus on discretizations of infinite-dimensional
problems such as integral and differential equations.
<P>
We present a limited number of computational examples. These examples
are intended to provide results that can be used to validate the
reader's own implementations and to give a sense of how the algorithms
perform. The examples are not designed to give a complete picture
of performance or to be a suite of test problems. 
<P>
The computational examples in this book were done with <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MATLAB&reg;</a> 
(version 4.0a on various SUN SPARCstations and version 4.1 on an Apple
Macintosh Powerbook 180) and the
MATLAB environment is an excellent one for getting experience with
the algorithms, for doing the exercises, and for small-to-medium
scale production work.&#185; MATLAB codes for many of the algorithms
are available by anonymous ftp.
If the reader has no access to MATLAB or will be solving very large
problems, the general algorithmic descriptions or even the
MATLAB codes can easily be translated to another language.
