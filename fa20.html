This user-oriented guide describes state-of-the-art methods for nonlinear <br>
equations and shows, via algorithms in pseudocode and Julia with several <br>
examples, how to choose an appropriate iterative method for a given <br>
problem and write an efficient solver or apply one written by others.
<p>
A sequel to the author's Solving Nonlinear Equations with Newton's Method
(SIAM, 2003), this book
<ul>
<li> contains new material on pseudo-transient continuation, mixed-precision solvers, and Anderson acceleration;
<li> is supported by a Julia package and a suite of Jupyter notebooks; 
and 
<li> includes examples of nonlinear problems from many disciplines.
</ul>
<p>
This book is intended for researchers who solve nonlinear equations, students in numerical analysis, and the Julia community.
