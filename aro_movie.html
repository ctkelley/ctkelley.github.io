Videos from Charlie Berger at ERDC
</H3>

These two videos are examples of the way in which the research
from Kelley's group has been deployed in ERDC's work. Four researchers
from ERDC 
Gaurav Savant, Tate O. McAlpin, Charlie Berger, and Jennifer N. Tate,
have applied Kelley's work on pseudo-transient continuation in their 
recent paper
<p>
<a href="Berger_Paper.pdf">
A Pseudo-Transient Continuation-Based Finite Element Hydrodynamic Model 
for Dam and Levee Failure.
</a>

They use the method to adjust the time-step size in a way to maintain
time accuracy and take few time steps than a standard error control
approach. This is an "out-of-the-box" application pseudo-transient 
continuation, which is designed for rapid integration to steady state as
opposed to time-accuracy. The authors modify pseudo-transient continuation
by putting a tight limit on the growth of the time step to preserve
time-accuracy, while allowing some growth after the initial transient
in the solution has passed.  The approach in the paper is the first to 
obtain an efficient and accurate implicit finite element solution of
dam and levee failures. 

The authors have shared some of the results of their simulations for a
real location (they can't tell me exactly where it is). They have created
videos for 
<a href="Velocity.avi">velocity</a> and 
<a href="Depth.avi">depth</a> of the wave following a dam failure.

Pseudo-Transient Continuation is now well integrated into ERDC's ADH
simulator.

Tim,

We've been using Pseudo Transient Continuation (PTC) for time dependent problems with some success.  We are setting a maximum time step size, so that we can get time accuracy.  However we are fixing the number of nonlinear iterations.  We use the initial steady residual to calculate the time step size (this is an indicator of the temporal variation).  If this time step size is above our maximum we just use the max.  So we are getting time accurate solutions (checked by reducing the max) with a model that selects its own time step.  Appears to work really well.

We also found that we had been using the previous steady residual to calcuate the time step.  When we used the current residual our steady-state calculations are much quicker and more stable.

In any case the PTC is helping us out a bunch.  If you need some examples of results for your PR, I'll be glad to send them along.

Thanks,
Charlie
